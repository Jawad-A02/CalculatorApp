# CalculatorApp
Developed a calculator app using Python and the Kivy framework. 
The app features a user-friendly interface with standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Implemented error handling to prevent invalid inputs and allow users to clear the input field. 
Additionally, optimized the app for mobile devices by designing the interface to be responsive to different screen sizes. 
This app could also be used to create an Android application that can be downloaded to users.
